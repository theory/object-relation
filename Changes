Revision history for Perl extension Object::Relation.

0.11
       - Changed version numbers to decimal strings instead of version
         objects. The version module is still required for tests and as
         a data type.
       - Changed the storage of version objects so that they will be properly
         order-able. Alpha version objects (those that include an underscore)
         are not supported.
       - Added Makefile.PL.
       - Fixed the contact address in each file. We're at kineticode.com, not
         obj_relode.com.
       - Fixed order of schema creation when classes use collections of other
         classes or extend, mediate, or make a type of another class.
       - Added Object::Relation::Meta::Class::Schema->dependencies to return a
         list of all Object::Relation::Base-inherited classes upon which a
         class depends. Used to simplify the repaired schema-generation
         ordering.
