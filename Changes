Revision history for Perl extension Object::Relation.

0.11
       - Changed version numbers to decimal strings instead of version
         objects. The version module is still required for tests and as
         a data type.
       - Changed the storage of version objects so that they will be properly
         order-able. Alpha version objects (those that include an underscore)
         are not supported.

0.1.0  2006-07-28T17:18:40
       - Initial public release
