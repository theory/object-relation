Revision history for Perl extension Object::Relation.

0.11
       - Changed version numbers to decimal strings instead of version
         objects. The version module is still required for tests and as
         a data type.
       - Changed the storage of version objects so that they will be properly
         order-able. Alpha version objects (those that include an underscore)
         are not supported.
       - Added Makefile.PL.
       - Fixed the contact address in each file. We're at kineticode.com, not
         obj_relode.com.
       - Fixed order of schema creation when classes use collections of other
         classes or extend, mediate, or make a type of another class.
       - Added Object::Relation::Meta::Class::Schema->dependencies to return a
         list of all Object::Relation::Base-inherited classes upon which a
         class depends. Used to simplify the repaired schema-generation
         ordering.
       - Fixed case where a class is used as an attribute more than once by
         another class. The upshot is that the table must be selected from
         twice in the view, so it now gets an alias for the attribute name and
         the table. Thus all of the references to the table had to be updated
         in the view and its rules, as well. Also, the columns used to select
         each contained object's attributes are named for the attribute
         instead of the key name of the referenced class.
       - Fixed broken methods query(), squery(), count(), query_uuids(), and
         squery_uuids() in Object::Relation::Base (and therefore all O::R
         classes).
       - Improved the error message when a required attribute is not defined
         so that the class key name is used in the error message. Thus,
         instead of getting 'Attribute "name" must be defined', you'll get the
         error, 'Attribute "one.name" must be defined'.
       - Now requring Class::Meta::Express 0.04.
